<h1>Flight-Administration-Tools</h1>

These tools initially got into my head, during my job at Invia Flights Germany. It's a pan-european leading travel agency.

Already at the beginning, I figured some workflows that are not just hard to follow, the were even hard to understand. "Why do I even do that?".
When there wasn't enough workload, I just started programming little tools in Notepad++, because it was the only code-editor pre-installed on the company-notebooks.

After discussing with some colleagues about that, I wanted to work on a version to publish, so we can share customer feedback and make workflows easier.

Following things are currently included:
<ul>
  <li>Surrounding register and login functionalities</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Register is possible with specific link and a given 10-numeric token.</li>
    <li>Login with username and hashed password</li>
    <li>Admin-status-functionality: e.g.: is able to delete any post, also from other users.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Template-Creator</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Our EDP tool had many E-Mail-Templates, but some important once were missing.</li>
    <li>I created some myself and inserted them here.</li>
    <li>A "copy-all" button instantly saves them to your clipboard to just paste them in the empty message field.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Mail-Documentation</li>
  <ul>
    <li>We get many mails and tasks over the day.</li>
    <li>If you want to keep a customer or a specific booking in mind, you can just enter them here.</li>
    <li>It's also a good way to see, what you actually did the whole day.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Tax-Compressor</li>
  <ul>
    <li>When calculating a refund or rebooking manually, we originally had a bunch of taxes, mixed together, with random spacings.</li>
    <li>I wanted to put that jibberish in a textarea and convert it.</li>
    <li>Now it get's filtered, compressed and listed, clearly arranged and among each other.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Feedback-Management</li>
  <ul>
    <li>There are some customers that had feedback or problems during the booking process or flight.</li>
    <li>To stay on track of multiple complaints, I wanted to create a little table, where any complaint got noted</li>
    <li>At the bottom right you can count, which kind of problem is occuring the most.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
</ul>

<h4>I also had further ideas: for example the generation of user-made templates with AI, depending on the former customer-message and the processing steps. The project is currently paused, since Invia didn't continue the contract with me.</h4>
